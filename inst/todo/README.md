# To do functions

This directory contains updated functions that have not yet made it into the package (i.e. are deemed production ready).

## Phasing

The phasing code has been rewritten, which is included in this directory. It does however produce slightly different numbers from the original script. For PCAWG the original script was used, however, for later projects the code in this directory was applied. Jonas Demeulemeester has rewritten parts of it, but this code is not yet available.

## SV parsing

This is experimental code to parse SVclone output and produce CCF values, requires further work.
